				<h4>My Education Can be Summarized into five points</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Middle School/Elementary</li>
					<li>High School</li>
					<li>Community College</li>
					<li>Graduate College</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Middle School/Elementary</h4>
				<p>I started my education at the standard age of 5 at a private institution. I consistantly received good marks never going below an A minus, I continued at this institution until the sixth grade at which point I was moved into public schooling. I continued my excellence well into high school</p>

				<h4>High School</h4>
				<p>I attended Ogemaw Heights High School for the standard four years, I received average marks and took advantage of the many availible tecnical courses including computers, machine tools, and electronics.</p>
				
				<h4>Kirtland Community College</h4>
				<p>Upon graduating High School I enrolled in the fall 2014 semester at Kirtland Community college pursuing a transfer degree in Computer Science and as a side objective an associates in applied science in the field of computer science. I attended for two years or five semesters attaining all major general education credits, some basic programming and computing skills, and the credits required to obtain my associates in applied science. I received an award for completing all availible maths courses at Kirtland and received good marks therein.</p>
				
				<h4>Saginaw Valley State University</h4>
				<p>Once I completed the furthest extent of my education at Kirtland I transfered over to Saginaw Valley State University where I now continue my education. I hope to have completed my education by as early as 2018 and expect to have received my B.S. in Computer Science</p>

				<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fa fa-user"></i>My Activities</h2>
				<div class="summary">
				
					<h4>I Have Taken Part in Many Activities</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Cross Country</li>
						<li>SkillsUSA</li>
						<li>Delta Tecnical Solutions</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Cross Country</h4>
					<p>I ran cross country four six years, having run in both high school and collegiately for Ogemaw Heights High School and Kirtland Community College respectively, I was team captain of the cross country team my senior year in high school and learned a great deal about leadership and teambuilding. I also learned the great fun and joy that pushing oneself to the limits can be.</p>
					
					<h4>SkillsUSA</h4>
					<p>SkillsUSA is a career and technical student organization that encompasses skilled trades. The organization focuses on helping skilled trades students further their tecnical skills and leadership skills. My junior year of high school I joined our local SkillsUSA chapter as a machinist. Come my senior year I joined our local chapters governing body as the chapter historian. My time as historian allowed me to learn detail orientation and helped to further my leadership skills. Our chapters governing body also attended a SkillsUSA leadership conference which assisted us in furthering ourselves and our duties. </p>
					
					<h4>Delta Tecnical Solutions</h4>
					<p>Both my junior and senior years of high school I took part in the Delta Tecnical Solutions competition in which students of differing skilled trades compete in their catagories. In both years I competed as a machinist in the Mill I and Mill II catagories. My senior year I took first place in the Mill II catagory. </p>
