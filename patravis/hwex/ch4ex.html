					<td>But when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint has not heard in his forest tht God is dead!"</td>
					<td>A madman went into a market with a latern crying "I seek God! I seek God!" many there did not believe in God and thus taunted "Has he got lost?", "Is he Hiding?". The Madman jumped into the middle of the group and cried "Whither is God?, I will tell you. We Have Killed him"</td>
					<td>God is dead... How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -- for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto</td>
