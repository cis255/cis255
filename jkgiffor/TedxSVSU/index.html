				<h1> What is TED? </h1>
				<p> "TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). 
				TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics
				— from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share 
				ideas in communities around the world." Source: www.ted.com. </p>
